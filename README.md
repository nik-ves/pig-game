# Pig game

Game starts with player one rolling the dice. His current score is saved until he either hits 1 with the dice, in which case current score will be set to 0 and player two will start playing, or chooses to hold the current score where the score is saved and player two starts playing. Same rules apply to both players. Player that hits 100 score first wins!
